**SiS - A Semantic Capability Model for Simulation of Manufacturing Processes**
---  
Simulations offer possibilities for the investigation of production processes. 
They depict various aspects of the production process and the associated production systems. 
However, a single simulation is often not sufficient to obtain a comprehensive understanding of certain process settings. 
Instead, a combination of different simulations is required, e.g., when the results of one simulation serve as input parameters for another, resulting in a sequence of simulations.
Manual planning of these sequences is considered a labor-intensive task that requires careful consideration of factors such as simulation time, simulation cost and quality of simulation results to select the optimal simulation scenario for a given request.
The SiS information model represents simulations, their ability to generate specific knowledge and their respective quality criteria and serves as a basis for the automatic generation of simulation sequences.
